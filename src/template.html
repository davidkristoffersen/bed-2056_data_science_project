      <h2>Overview and Motivation</h2>
      In late 2019 and early 2020 the Corona virus, originating from China,
      spread across the world. This lead to a global pandemic, where, in order
      to combat the spread of the virus, many nations enforced nation wide
      lockdowns. Following these lockdowns, media reported an increase in
      unemployment. This report will investigate these claims, and try to figure
      out if there is a correlation between the Corona virus and unemployment.
      <br />
      <br />
      We chose to focus on this because the pandemic is still on-going, and
      therefore very relevant. I addition, we think that it might show a variety
      of interesting results.

      <h2>Related Work</h2>
      The interest for this topic came from the fact that Corona is still
      on-going, and we were interested in doing our own research regarding the
      effects of the virus on a nation wide scale. We chose unemployment because
      it is has been in focul by the media. Additionally, data regarding this
      topic should be abundant.

      <h2>Initial Questions</h2>
      The questions this report will try to answer are: is there a real
      correlation between the Corona outbreak and unemployment rate, and if so,
      to what extent. Currently, as of writing this report there have been two
      major waves of Corona. The first occured in late February/early March of
      2020. The second, and most recent wave, occured just after the summer of
      2020.

      <h2>Data</h2>
      Since we have a variety of categories, we have used a number of different
      data sources.

      <h3>Unemployment rate Norway</h3>
      The data for unemployment rate in Norway is retrieved from Nav. Nav offers
      many great data sets, which can be found here:
      <a
        href="https://www.nav.no/no/nav-og-samfunn/statistikk/arbeidssokere-og-stillinger-statistikk/"
      >
        nav.no
      </a>
      <br />
      <br />
      The specific data set we used for unemployment was:
      <a
        href="https://www.nav.no/no/nav-og-samfunn/statistikk/arbeidssokere-og-stillinger-statistikk/hovedtall-om-arbeidsmarkedet/_/attachment/download/b4c655bf-de5c-4714-bf30-9d4d979fa45b:7e53be0947a6afdab3df01a0523a574d3e174277/HL100_Antall_helt_ledige_historisk._November_2020.xlsx"
      >
        Nav unemployment
      </a>
      <br />
      <br />
      To scrape the excel file, we used the python library pandas
      <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas.pydata.org</a>
      , which support reading excel formatted files.

      <h3>Unemployment rate USA</h3>
      The unempoyment rate data for USA comes from the U.S Bureau of Labor
      Statistics
      <a href="https://www.bls.gov">bls.gov</a>
      . To retrieve the data, we do a post request to their api
      <a href="https://api.bls.gov/publicAPI">api.bls.gov</a>
      , where we pass some parameters which specify what data we want. The
      result comes in JSON format, and we use the json python module to iterate
      and parse the data.

      <h3>Covid cases</h3>
      The data for the number of daily Covid cases is fetched from the European
      Centre for Disease Prevention and Control
      <a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en">ecdc.europa.eu</a>
      . They supply a variety of data sets involving Covid, amongst other
      things. The data we use can be found here
      <a
        href="https://opendata.ecdc.europa.eu/covid19/casedistribution/csv/data.csv"
      >
        ecdc Covid
      </a>
      . The data is in CSV format, so we can parse the data by separating the
      lines, and then separating the rows by comma to extract the values we are
      interested in.

      <h2>Exploratory Analysis</h2>
      All the plots were made using python and plotly
      <a href="https://plotly.com/python/">plotly.com</a>
      . Plotly is a library that lets you create interactive plots and graphs.
      You can interact with the plots by hovering over data points to see
      specific data point values, zoom in on specific parts of the graph by
      selecting/dragging the mouse over a part of the graph, and use the varying
      tools in the toolbar.

      </div>
      <div class="graph">
        <div class="plot" src="plots/covid_usa.html"></div>
      </div>

      <h2>Final Analysis</h2>
      Based on the data there appears to be a correlation between the number of
      Corona cases, or more specifically lockdowns, and unemployment. In March
      2020, both countries employed nation wide lockdowns, and the unemployment
      data clearly reflects this. Both countries have a sudden increase in
      unemployment around this time. Interestingly, the second wave does not
      seem to have affected the unemployment rate. This is likely because a
      second lockdown - at least at the time of writing - have not been enforced
      (yet). We suspect that if a second lockdown were to happen this would
      affect the data, hovewer not as extreme as the first.
