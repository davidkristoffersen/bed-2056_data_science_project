      <h2>Overview and Motivation</h2>
      In late 2019 and early 2020, the Coronavirus, originating from China,
      spread worldwide. Many nations enforced nationwide lockdowns in an attempt
      to combat the pandemic. Following these lockdowns, media across the world
      reported an increase in unemployment. This report will investigate these
      claims and figure out if there is a correlation between Coronavirus and
      unemployment. For simplicity's sake, we will focus on data from Norway and
      USA. We believe the majority of countries will have similar patterns.
      <br />
      <br />
      We chose to focus on this topic because the pandemic is still on-going,
      and therefore very relevant. Additionally, we think it might show a
      variety of fascinating results.

      <h2>Related Work</h2>
      The interest in this topic came from the fact that Covid-19 is still
      on-going, and we were interested in doing our research regarding the
      effects of the virus on a nationwide scale. We chose unemployment because
      it is has been in focus by the media. Additionally, data regarding this
      topic should be abundant.

      <h2>Initial Questions</h2>
      This report will analyze if there is a possible correlation between the
      Coronavirus and unemployment rate, and if so, to what extent. Currently,
      as of writing this report, there have been two waves of Covid-19 in Noway
      and three in USA. The first wave, for both countries, occurred in late
      February/early March 2020. USA's second outbreak occurred in the summer,
      and Norway's second and USA's third outbreaks started in October and are
      still on-going.

      <h2>Data</h2>
      Since we have a variety of categories, we have used several sources that
      we will present below.

      <h3>Unemployment rate Norway</h3>
      The data for the unemployment rate in Norway is retrieved from Nav. Nav
      offers many great data sets, which can be found here:
      <a
        href="https://www.nav.no/no/nav-og-samfunn/statistikk/arbeidssokere-og-stillinger-statistikk/"
      >
        nav.no
      </a>
      .
      <br />
      <br />
      The specific data set we used for unemployment was:
      <a
        href="https://www.nav.no/no/nav-og-samfunn/statistikk/arbeidssokere-og-stillinger-statistikk/hovedtall-om-arbeidsmarkedet/_/attachment/download/b4c655bf-de5c-4714-bf30-9d4d979fa45b:7e53be0947a6afdab3df01a0523a574d3e174277/HL100_Antall_helt_ledige_historisk._November_2020.xlsx"
      >
        Nav unemployment
      </a>
      .
      <br />
      <br />
      The data set comes in excel format. To scrape it, we used the python
      library pandas:
      <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas.pydata.org</a>
      , which supports reading excel formatted files.

      <h3>Unemployment rate USA</h3>
      The unemployment rate data for USA comes from the U.S Bureau of Labor
      Statistics:
      <a href="https://www.bls.gov">bls.gov</a>
      . To retrieve the data, we do a post request to their API:
      <a href="https://api.bls.gov/publicAPI">api.bls.gov</a>
      , where we pass some parameters which specify what data we want. The
      result comes in JSON format, and we use the json module for python to
      parse the data and extract the relevant information.

      <h3>Covid cases</h3>
      The data for the number of daily Covid cases is fetched from the European
      Centre for Disease Prevention and Control:
      <a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en">ecdc.europa.eu</a>
      . They supply a variety of data sets involving Covid, amongst other
      things. The data we use can be found here:
      <a
        href="https://opendata.ecdc.europa.eu/covid19/casedistribution/csv/data.csv"
      >
        ecdc Covid
      </a>
      . The data is in CSV format, and we can parse the data by first separating
      the lines, before separating the rows by commas to extract the values for
      Norway and USA.

      <h2>Exploratory Analysis</h2>
      All the plots were made using python and plotly:
      <a href="https://plotly.com/python/">plotly.com</a>
      . Plotly is a library for creating interactive plots and graphs. The plots
      can be interacted with by hovering over data points to see specific data
      point values, as well as zooming in on specific parts of the graph by
      selecting/dragging the mouse over the graph. In each plot, there is also a
      toolbar with a variety of tools.

      </small>
      <p>
        In Norway, we can see two significant waves of Covid, with the second
        wave having the highest amount of cases so far. As of writing this, the
        second wave is still on-going, however, it appears to be flattening out.
      </p>

      </div>
      <small class="figure-text">
        (Figure 2. Confirmed Covid cases in USA)
      </small>
      <p>
        In USA,
        <i>three</i>
        significant waves of Covid are identifiable, where the last wave has the
        highest amount of cases and is still on-going (as of writing this).
        Comparing this plot to the plot from Norway, we can see that Norway
        controlled the outbreak a lot better during the summer, barely having
        any cases.
      </p>

      <div class="graph">
        <div class="plot" src="plots/relative_covid.html"></div>

        (Figure 3. Confirmed Covid cases in Norway and UAS per 100 000 citizen)
      </small>
      <p>
        In this plot, we can see that both countries had a similar amount of
        confirmed covid cases in March. However, around the 28th of March 2020,
        Norway's Covid cases started declining, while USA's continued to
        increase. As previously mentioned, USA was not able to contain the
        spread during the summer, while Norway contained it very well. Both
        countries had a new wave in October, and from the plot we see that
        Norway contained it better by around 20%.
      </p>

      <div class="graph">
        <div class="plot" src="plots/unemployment.html"></div>
      </div>
      <small class="figure-text">
        (Figure 4. Unemployment rate for Norway and USA)
      </small>
      <p>
        Following the unemployment rate from 2015, we can see that it is slowly
        decreasing until the lockdown events in March 2020.
      </p>

      <div class="graph">
        <div class="plot" src="plots/relative_unemployment.html"></div>
      </div>
      <small class="figure-text">
        (Figure 5. Difference in unemployment rate between Norway and USA)
      </small>
      <p>
        This plot shows that the difference in unemployment between USA and
        Norway was steadily decreasing in the years prior to Covid-19. Since the
        lockdown in Norway was enforced earlier than USA we see the difference
        go into the negative, meaning Norway had a higher unemployment rate than
        USA. However, as soon as USA enforced their lockdown the graph went back
        up to USA having a significantly higher unemployment rate. Since the
        inital lockdowns the difference has been decreasing, however it is still
        significantly higher than what it was prior to Covid-19.
      </p>

      <h2>Final Analysis</h2>
      Based on the data, there appears to be a correlation between the number of
      Covid cases and unemployment rate. Looking at the plot for confirmed cases
      of Covid-19, we can see that when the covid cases increased and lockdowns
      were enforced, the unemployment also increased. Additionally, comparing
      the relative Covid cases graph (figure 4) and the relative unemployment
      graph (figure 5), we can see that USA had more confirmed cases, as well as
      higher unemployment rate, compared to Norway. This leads us to believe
      that there is a correlation between the number of Covid cases and the
      unemployment rate.
      <br />
      <br />

      Interestingly, in the following waves of Covid, no noticeable rise in
      unemployment was detected. We suspect this is the case for two main
      reasons:

      <ul>
        <li>
          People who lost their jobs found new jobs that did not require lay off
          in the case of an increase in Covid cases.
        </li>
        <li>
          No lockdowns have been enforced in the second (and third in the case
          of USA) wave.
        </li>
      </ul>

      At the time of writing this, no second lockdown has been enforced. If a
      second lockdown were to be enforced, we would expect to see an increase in
      unemployment again, however not as severe as the first.
