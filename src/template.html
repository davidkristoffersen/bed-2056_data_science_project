      <h2>Overview and Motivation</h2>
      In late 2019 and early 2020 the Corona virus, originating from China,
      spread across the world. This lead to a global pandemic, where, in order
      to combat the spread of the virus, many nations enforced nation wide
      lockdowns. Following these lockdowns, media across the world reported an
      increase in unemployment. This report will investigate these claims, and
      try to figure out if there is a correlation between the Corona virus and
      unemployment. For simplicity's sake, we will focus on data from Norway and
      USA. We believe the majority of countries will have similar patterns.
      <br />
      <br />
      We chose to focus on this topic because the pandemic is still on-going,
      and therefore very relevant. In addition, we think it might show a variety
      of interesting results.

      <h2>Related Work</h2>
      The interest for this topic came from the fact that Covid-19 is still
      on-going, and we were interested in doing our own research regarding the
      effects of the virus on a nation wide scale. We chose unemployment because
      it is has been in focus by the media. Additionally, data regarding this
      topic should be abundant.

      <h2>Initial Questions</h2>
      The questions this report will try to answer are: is there a real
      correlation between the Corona virus and unemployment rate, and if so, to
      what extent. Currently, as of writing this report there have been two
      waves of Covid-19 in Noway, and three in USA. The first wave, for both
      countries, occured in late February/early March 2020. America's second
      outbreak occured in the summer, and Norway's second and America's third
      started in October, and is still going on.

      <h2>Data</h2>
      Since we have a variety of categories, we have used several sources that
      we will present below.

      <h3>Unemployment rate Norway</h3>
      The data for unemployment rate in Norway is retrieved from Nav. Nav offers
      many great data sets, which can be found here:
      <a
        href="https://www.nav.no/no/nav-og-samfunn/statistikk/arbeidssokere-og-stillinger-statistikk/"
      >
        nav.no
      </a>
      <br />
      <br />
      The specific data set we used for unemployment was:
      <a
        href="https://www.nav.no/no/nav-og-samfunn/statistikk/arbeidssokere-og-stillinger-statistikk/hovedtall-om-arbeidsmarkedet/_/attachment/download/b4c655bf-de5c-4714-bf30-9d4d979fa45b:7e53be0947a6afdab3df01a0523a574d3e174277/HL100_Antall_helt_ledige_historisk._November_2020.xlsx"
      >
        Nav unemployment
      </a>
      <br />
      <br />
      The data set comes in excel format, to scrape it we used the python
      library pandas:
      <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas.pydata.org</a>
      , which support reading excel formatted files.

      <h3>Unemployment rate USA</h3>
      The unempoyment rate data for USA comes from the U.S Bureau of Labor
      Statistics:
      <a href="https://www.bls.gov">bls.gov</a>
      . To retrieve the data, we do a post request to their api:
      <a href="https://api.bls.gov/publicAPI">api.bls.gov</a>
      , where we pass some parameters which specify what data we want. The
      result comes in JSON format, and we use the json python module to iterate
      and parse the data.

      <h3>Covid cases</h3>
      The data for the number of daily Covid cases is fetched from the European
      Centre for Disease Prevention and Control:
      <a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en">ecdc.europa.eu</a>
      . They supply a variety of data sets involving Covid, amongst other
      things. The data we use can be found here:
      <a
        href="https://opendata.ecdc.europa.eu/covid19/casedistribution/csv/data.csv"
      >
        ecdc Covid
      </a>
      . The data is in CSV format, and we can parse the data by separating the
      lines, and then separating the rows by comma to extract the values we are
      interested in.

      <h2>Exploratory Analysis</h2>
      All the plots were made using python and plotly:
      <a href="https://plotly.com/python/">plotly.com</a>
      . Plotly is a library that lets you create interactive plots and graphs.
      You can interact with the plots by hovering over data points to see
      specific data point values, and zoom in on specific parts of the graph by
      selecting/dragging the mouse over a part of the graph. In each plot there
      is also a toolbar with a variety of tools

      <div class="graph">
        <div class="plot" src="plots/unemployment.html"></div>
      </div>
      <small class="center">
        (Figure 1. Unemployment rate for Norway and USA)
      </small>
      <br />
      Following the unemployment rate from 2015, we can see that it is slowly
      decreasing, until the lockdown events in March 2020.

      <div class="graph">
        <div class="plot" src="plots/covid_norway.html"></div>
      </div>
      <small class="center">(Figure 2. Confirmed Covid cases in Norway)</small>
      <br />
      In Norway, we can see two main waves of Covid, with the second wave having
      the highest amount of cases so far. As of writing this, the second wave is
      still on-going, however it appears to be flattening out.
      <div class="graph">
        <div class="plot" src="plots/covid_usa.html"></div>
      </div>
      <small class="center">(Figure 3. Confirmed Covid cases in USA)</small>
      <br />
      In USA,
      <i>three</i>
      main waves of Covid are identifiable, with the last having the highest
      amount of cases. Comparing this plot to the plot from Norway, we can see
      that Norway controlled the outbreak a lot better during the summer, barely
      having any cases.

      <h2>Final Analysis</h2>
      Based on the data, there appears to be a correlation between the number of
      Covid cases and unemployment rate. From the figures, we can see that as
      soon as the number of Covid cases increased, and lockdowns were enforced,
      the unemployment rate also increased. For the Norwegian unemployment data
      (figure 1), the plot might make it appear as though the unemployment rate
      increased before the lockdown, however this is because both the lockdown
      and the unemployment-peak were in the same month. In actuality, the
      unemployment rate followed the lockdown. Interestingly, in the following
      waves of Covid, no noticeable difference in unemployment was detected. We
      suspect this is the case for two main reasons:

      <ul>
        <li>
          People who lost their jobs found new jobs that did not require lay off
          in the case of an increase in Covid cases.
        </li>
        <li>
          No lockdowns have been enforced in the second (and third in the case
          of USA) wave.
        </li>
      </ul>

      At the time of writing this, a second lockdown has not been enforced.
      However, if a second lockdown were to be enforced, we would expect too see
      an increase in unemployment again, although not as severe as the first.
